# Airbnb for Dog Walks üêï

## Introduction

This project is an exercise from **The Hacking Project** bootcamp.

The idea? Build the "Airbnb of dog walking" ‚Äî a platform where users can offer or request dog walks in exchange for cold hard cash üí∏. This app connects dog owners with people willing to walk their pets. Simple, practical, scalable.

This project focuses on the design of a solid database schema and the implementation of user and service logic in Ruby on Rails.
